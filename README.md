# Test-Driven Development with Python

This repository contains a To-Do list web app, constructed with the help of the
book [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/).

The completed app can be found here: http://superlists-1234.xyz

It runs on an EC2 instance of aws, so if the link above is not working is because 
I had to stop the instance (I get charged :sweat_smile:).
